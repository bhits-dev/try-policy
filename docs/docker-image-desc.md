# What is Try My Policy?

Try My Policy is a service that enables patients to preview the redacted version of their uploaded clinical document based on the privacy preferences of the consent. Try My Policy calls Document Segmentation Service ([DSS](https://github.com/bhits/dss)) to (1) segment the patient's clinical document, in the template prescribed by C-CDA-R1, C-CDA-R2 and HITSP C32 and (2) highlight the sections that will be removed in accordance to the patient's consent. Try My Policy transforms the response from DSS into a full XHTML file and provides the Base 64 encoded file in the response JSON. This service is currently utilized in the Consent2Share UI (c2s-ui) for patients to try their policies on their uploaded documents.

# How to use this image


## Start a Try My Policy instance

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the repository's [README.md](https://github.com/bhits/try-policy) file before starting the instance.

`docker run  --name try-policy -d bhits/try-policy:latest <additional program arguments>`

*NOTE: In order for this service to fully function as a microservice in the Consent2Share application, it is required to setup the dependency microservices and support level infrastructure. Please refer to the [Consent2Share Deployment Guide](https://github.com/bhits/consent2share/releases) in the corresponding Consent2Share release for instructions to setup the Consent2Share infrastructure.*

## Configure

The Spring profiles `application-default` and `docker` are activated by default when building images.

This service can run with the default configuration which is from three places: `bootstrap.yml`, `application.yml`, and the data which the [`Configuration Server`](https://github.com/bhits/config-server) reads from the `Configuration Data Git Repository`. Both `bootstrap.yml` and `application.yml` files are located in the class path of the running application.

We **recommend** overriding the configuration as needed in the `Configuration Data Git Repository`, which is used by the `Configuration Server`.

Also, [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) supports other ways to override the default configuration to configure the service for a certain deployment environment. 

The following is an example to override the default database password:

`docker run -d bhits/try-policy:latest --spring.datasource.password=strongpassword`
